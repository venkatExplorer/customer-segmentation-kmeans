# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to group customers based on their **Age** and **Spending Score**. It's a basic machine learning example to explore customer behavior and segmentation.

##  What It Does

- Loads customer data from a CSV file
- Visualizes Age vs Spending Score
- Groups customers into different clusters using K-Means
- Plots clusters in color for easy understanding

##  Tech Stack

- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)

##  Files

- `customers.csv` - Sample customer data
- `kmeans_customers.py` - Main Python script
- `README.md` - You’re reading it!

## What You'll Learn

- How K-Means clustering works
- How to visualize clusters with Python
- Real-world application of unsupervised learning

##  Sample Output

You’ll see a colorful scatter plot showing how customers are grouped by spending behavior and age.

##  Why This Project?

It's a great starter project for those exploring:
- Machine learning with Python
- Customer behavior analytics
- Data visualization techniques

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` installed
3. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python kmeans_customers.py
